        Being an expert in surface level IT solutions, the average architects process and every way to make a sweet
        potato fry; I pride myself in creativity. Consistently learning html and css brings me closer every day to
        creating an application that all my peers and I can enjoy together, as well as develop a stabel career for my
        future.

        Looking back at my educational resume, it seems that graphic design courses was only the start of the colorfully
        abstract path that lead me where I am today. Not just struggling to adjust margins but surprisingly excited to
        see the outcome of a weeks worth of CSS.
